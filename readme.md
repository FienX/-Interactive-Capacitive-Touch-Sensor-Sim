# Capacitive Touch Sensor Simulator

This project simulates the behavior of a capacitive touch sensor, allowing users to input sensor readings and observe the sensor's response.

## Features

- Simulates a capacitive touch sensor with user-defined threshold
- Allows user input for sensor calibration and readings
- Detects touch events and calculates touch strength
- Logs all sensor activities with timestamps
- Saves log to a file for later analysis

## Usage

1. Run the simulator:
